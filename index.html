       <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.</li>
       <li>The element that holds all the children—in this case, the 'body' element—is known as the parent element.</li>
       <li>The 'body' element is an example of a semantic HTML element. In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
